# London Food Hygiene Ratings

## Interactive Front End Development with Javascript
A live demo of this project can be viewed [here](https://andrewsui.github.io/tgc07-project02/index.html).

This project is a single page application designed as a mock-up of what the UK Food Standards Agency's Food Hygiene Rating Scheme search feature could potentially look like. The data set used in this project has been limited to just London data in order to prevent the data folder size from getting too large.

### Disclaimer
Data used in this project pertaining to businesses and food hygiene ratings was downloaded from the UK [Food Standards Agency website](https://ratings.food.gov.uk/open-data/en-GB) on 21 July 2020 and has not been updated since this date. Any actual searches for London or UK Food Hygiene Rating Scheme data should be conducted via the Food Standards Agency's [search feature](https://ratings.food.gov.uk/).
